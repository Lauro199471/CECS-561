2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.077 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/xbar/inst/gen_sasd.crossbar_sasd_0/splitter_aw/m_ready_d_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/MAXIGP0WREADY (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on switches_tri_i[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on switches_tri_i[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on switches_tri_i[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on switches_tri_i[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>
