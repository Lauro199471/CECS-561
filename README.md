<h1 align="center">CECS 561 <br> Hardware/Software Co-Design </h1>	

## Course Description
The course will cover hardware/software codesign of embedded systems with aconcentration on system level design and interfacing, given a microprocessor system andsome peripherals. It covers embedded system design flow from system specification toboth hardware and software implementation and testing. Students will learn how tointegrate software and hardware in FPGA-based embedded systems. This course makesuse of techniques and technology used in industry, and will provide students with a solidbasis by which to interface, design, and program microprocessor systems. Students willgain design experience with project/case studies using contemporary high-level methodsand industry EDA tools.
